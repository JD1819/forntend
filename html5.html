• How to embed audio and video in a webpage?
* To embed audio in HTML, we use the <audio> tag. Before HTML5, audio cannot be added to web pages  
  in the Internet Explorer era. To play audio, we used web plugins like Flash. After the release of HTML5, it is possible.

  Syntax:

<audio>
    <source src="file_name" type="audio_file_type">
</audio>

To embed video in HTML, we use the <video> tag. It contains one or more video sources at a time using <source> tag. 

Syntax

<video>
    <source src="file_name" type="video_file_type">
</video>



• Semantic element in HTML5?
*Semantic HTML elements are those that clearly describe their meaning in a human- and machine-readable way. Elements such as <header> , <footer> and <article> are all considered semantic because they accurately describe the purpose of the element and the type of content that is inside them.
